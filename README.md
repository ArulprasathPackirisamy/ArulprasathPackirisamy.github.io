## Profile

Senior Software Architect with 8+ years of experience in Java, Python, and microservice-based system design. Proven expertise in CI/CD pipelines, DevOps, artifact management, and real-time distributed systems. Adept in cloud-native development (AWS, OpenShift), containerization (Docker), and secure data ingestion workflows. Strong background in banking and enterprise-scale environments with millions of transactions and high security requirements.

I specialize in architecting scalable, distributed systems and end-to-end DevOps pipelines, with deep expertise in artifact hosting, CI/CD automation, and secure software distribution. With hands-on experience in Java and Python, I've led projects involving high-volume build systems, vectorized search platforms, and real-time transaction processing in cloud-native environments.

I've built secure, performance-optimized AI/ML solutions, including NLP/NLQ-powered chatbots and internal knowledge bases using Milvus, Chroma, and Hugging Face models. I've also worked extensively with embedding techniques and indexing algorithms (HNSW, IVF, PQ) to support high-throughput search and intelligent content retrieval in production systems.

My tech stack includes Apache tools (Maven, Flink, Iceberg), Spring Boot, Hive, ELK, and cloud platforms like AWS & GCP. I'm proficient in Docker, OpenShift, Kubernetes, and have implemented artifact ingestion, package distribution, and repository management using tools like GitLab CI, Nexus, and Airflow. My strength lies in delivering cloud-ready software distribution systems that are reliable, secure, and capable of serving millions of API requests and terabytes of artifact downloads.

A strong cross-functional communicator and strategic thinker, I lead from the front‚Äîensuring robust architecture, seamless stakeholder alignment, and operational excellence across SDLC phases. I have successfully delivered globally distributed enterprise solutions in the banking domain, combining innovation, automation, and performance at scale.
